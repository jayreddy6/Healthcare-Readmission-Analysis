# 🏥 Healthcare Readmission Risk Analysis

This project is an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning pipeline that predicts patient readmission risk using healthcare data. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and interactive dashboarding for business insights.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Predict whether a patient is likely to be readmitted
- Identify key factors contributing to readmissions
- Build an automated pipeline using Python and AWS
- Visualize trends and insights using Power BI or Tableau
